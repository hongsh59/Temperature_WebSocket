This repo supports the article Hardware Hacking with JavaScript featured on Smashing Magazine.

To get started, with node and NPM installed, open your terminal/command line and run:

```javascript
npm install
```

You will need the hardware described in the article to run these examples

## Example 1 - Hello World

```

## Example 2 - Home Automation

node server.js
```

## Other examples
